              Petra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan,
              set in a basin among the mountains that run from the Dead Sea to
              the Gulf of Aqaba. It is both a symbol of Jordan, as well as being
              Jordan's most visited tourist attraction, with numbers peaking at
              1 million in 2010. Petra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site
              since 1985, described as "one of the most precious cultural
              properties of man's cultural heritage".

                Petra is believed to have been settled as early as 9,000 BC. It
                became the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans
                were nomadic Arabs who used Petra because it was near the spice
                trade routes. The Nabataean Kingdom became a client state of the
                Roman Empire in the first century BC and in 106 AD they lost
                their independence. Petra's importance declined as sea trade
                routes developed as well as the 363 earthquake that let to many
                structures being destroyed. The Byzantine Era led to the
                construction of several Christian churches, but the city
                continued to decline and by the early Islamic era only a handful
                of nomads lived in Petra. It stayed unknown to the world until
                it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Famous
                for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is
                also called the Rose City due to the color of the stone out of
                which it is carved.
