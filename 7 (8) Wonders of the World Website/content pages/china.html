              The Great Wall of China is made of cement, rocks, bricks, and
              powdered dirt. It was finished in 1878 and was built to protect
              the northern part of the empire of China from enemy attacks. As the
              longest structure that has been constructed by humans it stands at
              13,171 miles long, 30 ft wide and 50 ft high. It holds 7,000
              watchtowers, blockhouses for soldiers, and beacons to send smoke
              signals.

              <p class="card-text">
                The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, also called
                Shihuangdi, started the Qin Dynasty. The Xiongnu tribes in the
                north of China were his enemies and with the land in some parts
                of China being easy to cross, Qin Shi Huang started building the
                Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade.
                Other dynasties in China worked more on the wall and made it
                longer. The Han, Sui, Northern, and Jin Dynasties all repaired,
                rebuilt, or expanded the Great Wall. During the Ming Dynasty,
                major rebuilding work took place, where sections of the wall
                were rebuilt with bricks and stone instead of earth, taking more
                than 2,000 years to complete the Great Wall. A common myth is
                you can see the Great Wall from space and it is possible to see
                the Great Wall of China from low Earth orbit, however you need
                to know where to look and good atmosphere conditions and
                weather.
