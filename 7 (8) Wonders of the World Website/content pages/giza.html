              The Great Pyramid of Giza is a defining symbol of Egypt and the
              last of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. It is located on
              the Giza plateau near the modern city of Cairo and was built over
              a twenty-year period during the reign of the king Khufu (2589-2566
              BCE, also known as Cheops) of the 4th Dynasty.

              <p class="card-text">
                The pyramid rises to a height of 479 feet (146 metres) with a
                base of 754 feet (230 metres) and is comprised of over two
                million blocks of stone. Some of these stones are of such
                immense size and weight (such as the granite slabs in the King's
                Chamber) that the logistics of raising and positioning them so
                precisely seems an impossibility by modern standards. An
                enduring theory regarding the monument's construction is that it
                was built on the backs of slaves. Contrary to the popular
                opinion that Egyptian monuments in general, and the Great
                Pyramid in particular, were built using Hebrew slave labor, the
                pyramids of Giza and all other temples and monuments in the
                country were constructed by Egyptians who were hired for their
                skills and compensated for their efforts. No evidence of any
                kind whatsoever - from any era of Egypt's history - supports the
                narrative events described in the biblical Book of Exodus.
